The to-do list app is a web-based application developed using Node.js, a popular backend JavaScript runtime, Express, a web application framework, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database. The app is designed to help users organize their tasks in a simple and easy-to-use manner.

With the app, users can perform various operations on their to-do items, including creating new items, reading existing items, updating items, and deleting items. Users can add new items to the list by providing a title and a description. Once an item is created, it is displayed in the list along with other items.

Users can mark items as completed by clicking on a checkbox next to the item title. Completed items are crossed out to indicate that they have been completed. Users can also delete items from the list by clicking on a delete button next to each item.
